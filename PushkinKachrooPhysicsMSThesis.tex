\documentclass[oneside,12pt]{book}
    % The option oneside is required for UNLV theses.
    % The 12pt is optional -- UNLV will allow 10pt too.
    % 10pt is the default, so to switch to 10pt, just delete 12pt in the above.
\usepackage{amsthm,amssymb,amsmath,graphicx} % Optional packages.
\usepackage{setspace,UNLVthesis} % Required packages.  Look at UNLVthesis.sty to see how
    % LaTeX is instructed to set things up.  This file may need some tweaking.
    % setspace.sty is not normally part of MikTeX.  It can be obtained from www.ctan.org.
    % Do a search on setspace.sty.
    % The files setspace.sty and UNLVthesis.sty should be in the same directory
    % as this file (or in a directory of MikTeX where LaTeX will know to find it
    % -- for example, where other style files are).
\pagestyle{unlv} %  This is defined in UNLVthesis.sty.  Headings are empty except for page numbers,
    % and the page numbers are the same size as the text.  Most documents use a different size so that
    % it it is difficult to mistake it as part of the text.

%These define the format and numbering of theorem like environments.
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
\newtheorem{corollary}[theorem]{Corollary}%Corollaries and Lemmas are numbered as theorems.
\newtheorem{lemma}[theorem]{Lemma}

%These define the format and numbering of definition like environments.
\theoremstyle{definition}%This environment is not in italics, like theorems are.
\newtheorem{definition}{Definition}
\newtheorem*{introduction}{Introduction}%The * means it is unnumbered.
\newtheorem*{conclusion}{Conclusion}

% Put definitions here.  For example, suppose you often use the Greek characters
% alpha, beta, etc., which in LaTeX are \alpha, \beta, etc. (in math mode only).
% Then it may be easier to create shortcuts for these commands, such as:
%\def\aa{\alpha}
%\def\bb{\beta}
% Now, instead of typing \alpha, we can type \aa.
% Here's another I often use:
\def\Bbb#1{{\mathbb #1}} % \Bbb is an obsolete command, but I'm old
% and still use it, so I define it to do what it used to do.  The usage
% is like \Bbb R, which will produce a blackboard bold R, and is literally
% translated to {\mathbb R}.  Note that this command includes a single
% argument.

\begin{document}
\pagenumbering{roman}% Items before Chapter one have roman numbers (if any).
\include{Titlepage} %Replace this file name with the name of your title page.
    % A copyright statement is optional and would be placed here.
    % The copyright page has no page number -- the title page is always page i and the
    % Thesis Approval page is always page ii.
\newpage \setcounter{page}{3} %The Thesis Approval page is page ii.  It is inserted separately.
\include{Abstract} % This is where the abstract goes.

\tableofcontents %inserts table of contents
\listoffigures \addcontentsline{toc}{schapter}{\listfigurename}% Comment these out if there are no figures or tables.
\listoftables \addcontentsline{toc}{schapter}{\listtablename}%
\include{Acknowledgements}  %Acknowledgements come after the tables.

\newpage % Do not remove this command.  It's there to make sure the page numbering is correct.
\pagenumbering{arabic} %Chapter 1 begins on page 1.

\include{Chapter1} %Replace these with your chapters.
