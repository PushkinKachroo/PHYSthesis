This thesis studies the incompleteness theorem as well Gentzen's inconsistency theorems in the context of quantum logic.  As quantum logic is based on a lattice and not Boolean logic, its meta analysis is very different.  This thesis is devoted to studying the differences that this structure provides and how those differences relate to the incompleteness and inconsistency theorems.
